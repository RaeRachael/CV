Someone who wants to find was to make a meaningful contribution to society, but lacking the ability to clearly communicate using written or spoken languages most of the time, I have begun to look for ways to utilise programming skills to be productive. Having only really had experience with Fortran, I am currently working on learning to code in other languages (namely Ruby and JavaScript) and to develop the skills to be confident in learning and using others when the time comes. 


## Skills

#### Clear Comunication

I feel that over the last 12 week of remote learning and pair programming, that I have developed a lot of skills needed for being adaptable and being able to explain things, even when the internet connection isn't perfect and when we have very different backgrounds and even different first languages. I feel that if more than one person is working on the code and not everyone understands what is going on, then there has been a failure in either write code that is understandable or in explaining what is happening. I feel very confident that over the 12 week Makers course that I didn't leave a pairing session where both didn't understand the code and how it worked, and that by explaining how the code works (or should work) it is easier to spot refactors - and who doesn't like writing or seeing better code!

#### Learning New languages, Technologies and Processes

Having done a some programming for both my Masters project at university and in my PhD project, which I unfortunetly didn't get to finish, I can see how the purpose of why code is written can lead to a very different style of coding. In both of those science projects (written in FORTRAN) the only person who would be looking at the code would be myself and the only thing that mattered was the processed data at the end, this lead to very long functions that had many purposes (which while understandable to the auther wouldn't be the easiest to understand), and also uses a language that by its nature doesn't lead to the easiest to read code (as it is streamlined to deal with processesing very large data sets). 

So I appreciate the clarity that comes with code writen using OOPs and via TDD, and getting used to making code legible for other people to work on it. Having written code without any tests and having to hunt down bugs without them and also how easy it can be to forget the exact purpose of the code is, I never want to go back to coding with writing tests, to help maintain the functionality of the code but to also increase the standard at which the code is written.

#### A desire to have fun while writing as good as code as I can

I think that the [exploration game](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game) that I starting writing in Ruby at the start of the Makers code shows not only my development in writing code, testing and design, but also a willingness to have some fun and look into new challenges, requiring new skills and knowledge to produce. Inparticular how to make it have a realtime response to individual key presses and how one can go about testing this functionality.
