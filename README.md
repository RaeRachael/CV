Someone who wants to find was to make a meaningful contribution to society, I have begun to look for ways to utilise programming skills to be productive moving away from coding for oneself on local systems, to coding for and with others in a more interactive way. Having only really had experience with Fortran, I am currently working on learning to code in other languages (namely Ruby, JavaScript, Typescript and C#) and to develop the skills to be confident in learning and using new laguages/technologies when the time comes. 


## Skills

#### Clear Comunication

I feel that over the last 12 week of remote learning and pair programming, that I have developed a lot of skills needed for being adaptable and being able to explain things, even when the internet connection isn't perfect and when we have very different backgrounds and even different first languages. I feel that if more than one person is working on the code and not everyone understands what is going on, then there has been a failure in either write code that is understandable or in explaining what is happening. I feel very confident that over the 12 week Makers course that I didn't leave a pairing session where both didn't understand the code and how it worked, and that by explaining how the code works (or should work) it is easier to spot refactors - and who doesn't like writing or seeing better code!

#### Learning New languages, Technologies

Having done a some programming for both my Masters project at university and in my PhD project, which I unfortunetly didn't get to finish, I can see how the purpose of why code is written can lead to a very different style of coding. In both of those science projects (written in FORTRAN) the only person who would be looking at the code would be myself and the only thing that mattered was the processed data at the end, this lead to very long functions that had many purposes (which while understandable to the auther wouldn't be the easiest to understand). So I appreciate the clarity that comes with code writen using OOPs and via TDD, and getting used to making code legible for other people to work on it. Having written code without any tests and having to hunt down bugs without them and also how easy it can be to forget the exact purpose of the code is, I never want to go back to coding with writing tests, to help maintain the functionality of the code but to also increase the standard at which the code is written.

Over the course of the last few months I have learnt and written code ruby ([exploration game](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game)) and in JavaScript ([MakersB_B](https://github.com/nadinedelia/MakersBnB)), and using new frameworks like express, react and rails.


#### Agile Processes

During the [final project](https://github.com/RaeRachael/invimcible_front_end) of the Makers course I was working as part of a team of six people, and to faciliate this project we made sure to follow agile processes much like the rest of the team projects done in the course. This involved meeting as a team at the start and end of the day going through the plan of the day and reviewing code to be merge into the master branch, in addition we catched up with each other over the course of the day to discuss any blockers that were stopping progress. We endding up summerising how the project was going via the wiki in the project every two days, and utilised a Trello board to visualise the tasks each Pair would be working on. 

#### A desire to have fun while writing as good as code as I can

I think that the [exploration game](https://github.com/RaeRachael/exploration_game) that I starting writing in Ruby at the start of the Makers code shows not only my development in writing code, testing and design, but also a willingness to have some fun and look into new challenges, requiring new skills and knowledge to produce. Inparticular how to make it have a realtime response to individual key presses and how one can go about testing this functionality. In addition I have now made a [JS version](https://github.com/RaeRachael/JS_exploration_game) which is playable at [this site](http://exploration-game.surge.sh/)

## Experience

Started a PhD in Oceanography in October 2016 at the unviersity of Hamburg. In which I made localised models for internal gravity waves and background flows, written in fortran, with graphically displays of the resulting data created via MatLab, unfortunetly I had to stop the PhD mental health reasons  

## Hobbies

Making art out of string, rope and random objects.
