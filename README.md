Someone who wants to find was to make a meaningful contribution to society, but lacking the ability to clearly communicate using written or spoken languages most of the time, I have begun to look for ways to utilise programming skills to be productive. Having only really had experience with Fortran, I am currently working on learning to code in other languages (namely Ruby) and to develop the skills to be confident in learning and using others when the time comes. 


## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
